# Car Pricing Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing car pricing data to uncover trends, patterns, and insights. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization to better understand the factors influencing car prices.

## Project Structure

- **`car_pricing_analisys.ipynb`**: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
- **`clean_cardb.csv`**: A cleaned version of the car pricing dataset (generated during the analysis).
- **`raw_cardb.csv`**: Directory containing the raw car pricing dataset (if applicable).

## Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing for car pricing datasets.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify key trends and patterns.
- Visualizations to highlight relationships between variables and car prices.
